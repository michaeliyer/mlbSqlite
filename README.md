## Files

- `mlbSqlPlayers.js` - Original JavaScript data file
- `hofMembers.csv` - CSV version of the data
- `js_to_csv.py` - Script that converted JS to CSV
- `load_database.py` - Script that loads data into SQLite database
- `query_examples.py` - Example queries demonstrating database usage
- `mlbSql.db` - SQLite database file

## Usage

### Loading the Database

```bash
python3 load_database.py
```

### Running Example Queries

```bash
python3 query_examples.py
```

### Custom Queries

You can run custom SQL queries using the SQLite command line tool:

```bash
sqlite3 mlbSql.db
```

Example queries:

```sql
-- Find all players inducted in a specific year
SELECT firstName, lastName, position
FROM hof_members
WHERE yearInducted = 1982;

-- Find players by team
SELECT DISTINCT h.firstName, h.lastName, h.position
FROM hof_members h
JOIN player_teams pt ON h.id = pt.player_id
JOIN teams t ON pt.team_id = t.id
WHERE t.name LIKE '%Yankees%';

-- Find players with specific awards
SELECT DISTINCT h.firstName, h.lastName, a.name
FROM hof_members h
JOIN player_awards pa ON h.id = pa.player_id
JOIN awards a ON pa.award_id = a.id
WHERE a.name LIKE '%MVP%';
```

## Data Sources

The original data was compiled from various sources including:

- Baseball Hall of Fame official records
- Baseball Reference
- MLB historical data
- Various baseball encyclopedias and reference materials

## Notes

- Some players may have `yearInducted` as NULL if they haven't been officially inducted yet
- Team names include historical variations (e.g., "Brooklyn Dodgers" vs "Los Angeles Dodgers")
- Awards are stored as individual entries, so a player with "3Ã— All-Star" would have one award entry
- Batting and throwing hands are stored as comma-separated values for players who used multiple hands
